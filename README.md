Hey there! I'm MrCoder – a passionate developer who has been working on a public bot for a year now. The bot features the latest slash and prefix commands, premium versions, and a variety of categories. From entertainment to productivity – there's something for everyone. I've been working as a software developer since 13.11.23, starting my journey with a keen interest in the field from a young age. In my private life, I enjoy working on other projects to take a break from the daily grind.
